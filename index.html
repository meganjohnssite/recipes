		<h2>Italian, anyone?</h2>
			<p>Three years ago, I had the opportunity to travel to Northern Italy and taste some of the best food I've had in my life! I've include my favorite meals below.</p>
				<h3>Bistecca alla Fiorentina</h3>
				<p>Florence is famous for "Bistecca alla Florentina", which is a delicious cut of meat. Most restaurants have large sides of beef hanging in the windows. It's a massive cut of meat, and so delicious!</p>

				<h3>Gelato</h3>
				<p>Italy is famous for gelato. We enjoyed this sweet treat everyday. I've listed below my top three flavors:
					<ol>
						<li>Passion fruit</li>
						<li>Cookies and Cream</li>
						<li>Lavender</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
